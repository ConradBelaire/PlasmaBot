# PlasmaBot
Lovely little discord bot, mostly made for the purpose of learning.



Big thanks to:

[Dev Dungeon](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/make-discord-bot-python) for the tutorial, I would not have been able to make this bot without it.

[Dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-api-tutorial/) for teaching me how to use APIs.

[leovoel's basic_bot.py](https://gist.github.com/leovoel/46cd89ed6a8f41fd09c5) for using extensions.
