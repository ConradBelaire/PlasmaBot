# PlasmaBot
Lovely little discord bot, mostly made for the purpose of learning.
Not all of the code here is mine, and a lot of it that is is modified from other code.

The prefix is ``, type ``help to see its commands.

Currently, the highlight is being able to print a random @dril tweet using ``dril.


Big thanks to:
